# audiopus_sys builds Opus via cmake which uses /MDd (debug CRT) in debug builds,
# but Rust always links /MD (release CRT). This causes LNK2001 for _CrtDbgReportW.
# Adding ucrtd.lib provides the missing debug CRT symbol without breaking anything -
# it's only called by debug assertion macros in third-party C code.
