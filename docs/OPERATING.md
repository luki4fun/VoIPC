# Running a VoIPC relay

For whoever runs the server. The README's Quick Start gets a relay up; this guide covers
running one for real: installing it, keeping it up, and backing it up and upgrading it
without losing anything.

## 1. Install

Pick one:
- **The static binary**, `voipc-server-linux-x86_64` from a
  [release](https://github.com/luki4fun/voipc/releases/latest). It runs on any x86-64 Linux.
  Verify it first ([SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#verifying-a-download)):

      sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
      gh attestation verify voipc-server-linux-x86_64 --repo luki4fun/voipc
      install -m 0755 voipc-server-linux-x86_64 /usr/local/bin/voipc-server

- **The container image**, `ghcr.io/luki4fun/voipc-server:<version>`. See section 10.
- **From source:** see [BUILDING.md](../BUILDING.md). The web client must be built first, since
  the server embeds it.

## 2. Where things live

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `/etc/voipc/server.toml` | the configuration |
| `/var/lib/voipc/` | the working directory: `channels.json`, `server_settings.json`, `bans.json` (relays without accounts), `voipc.db` and its key file (relays with accounts) |

Paths in `server.toml` that are not absolute are relative to the working directory. Give the
certificate, the key and the database full paths, or start the relay in `/var/lib/voipc`, as
the unit below does.

A relay without accounts writes nothing but `bans.json`, the bans that outlast a restart.

## 3. systemd

```

    useradd --system --home /var/lib/voipc --shell /usr/sbin/nologin voipc
    systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl enable --now voipc
    systemd-analyze security voipc      # 1.5 "OK" for this unit

- **A fixed `voipc` user, not `DynamicUser`.** The admin commands run as a second process on the
  same database. Run them as that user:

      sudo -u voipc voipc-server --config /etc/voipc/server.toml admin grant <name> admin

  Run as root, they would leave root-owned `-wal`/`-shm` files that the service then cannot
  open.
- **Certificates:** `LoadCredential` hands the relay its Let's Encrypt certificate and key
  without opening `/etc/letsencrypt` to it.
- **Stopping:** the relay stops cleanly on SIGTERM, which is what `systemctl stop` sends.

## 4. TLS

- The certificate and key are read once, at start; there is no reload. A certbot deploy hook
  therefore restarts the service (`systemctl restart voipc`). That drops calls in progress, so
  schedule the renewal for a quiet hour.
- With a self-signed certificate, apps trust it the first time they see it. Tell your users
  its fingerprint, so they can compare it with the one the app shows at first contact:

      voipc-server --config /etc/voipc/server.toml cert fingerprint

  The relay also logs the fingerprint at start.

## 5. Network

- Open TCP **and** UDP on the port (9987 by default). TCP serves the page and the fallback;
  UDP carries QUIC.
- **If UDP is blocked** in front of the server, the page loads but nobody connects.
  `sudo tools/udp-diag.sh` shows where the packets are dropped. If you cannot open UDP, set
  `tcp_fallback = true`; clients then carry everything over the TCP port. Keep `tcp_port` equal
  to `udp_port`.
- IPv6 and hosts with several addresses: see the notes under the config sample in the README.

## 6. Accounts

- **The key file** (`key_file`, or `VOIPC_ACCOUNTS_KEY`) seals the two-factor secrets and keys
  everything the relay hashes. Without it the database is of no use: back the two up together.
- **Postgres:** use `sslmode=verify-full` in the URL when the database is on another host.
- **Commands:**
  - `admin grant|revoke <name> admin|moderator`;
  - `admin reset-2fa <name>`;
  - `admin invite`;
  - `ban list|add|remove`.
  - [ACCOUNTS.md](ACCOUNTS.md) has the details.

## 7. Backups

- **SQLite:** copy the database while the relay runs, readable by the owner only, and keep the
  key file with the copy:

      sudo -u voipc voipc-server --config /etc/voipc/server.toml db backup /var/backups/voipc/voipc-$(date +%F).db

- **Postgres:** use `pg_dump`.
- **Also back up** `server.toml`, `channels.json`, `server_settings.json` and `bans.json`.
- **How long to keep backups: 30 days at most.** A person who deletes their account or their
  kept messages expects them gone. A backup brings them back until it is itself deleted.
- **Restore:** stop the service, copy the files back, start it again. Test a restore once,
  before you need one.

A daily timer:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/voipc-backup.service
[Service]
Type=oneshot
User=voipc
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c 'voipc-server --config /etc/voipc/server.toml db backup /var/backups/voipc/voipc-$(date +%%F).db && find /var/backups/voipc -name "voipc-*.db" -mtime +30 -delete'

# /etc/systemd/system/voipc-backup.timer
[Timer]
OnCalendar=daily
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Create `/var/backups/voipc`, owned by `voipc` with mode 0700, and copy the key file there once.

## 8. Upgrading

1. **Read the release notes' first line.** If the protocol changed, every client has to update
   too. The apps say so when they connect.
2. **Verify the download** (section 1).
3. **Back up** (section 7).
4. **Stop, replace the binary, start.** Database migrations run at start.

A rollback needs the old binary **and** the backup taken before the upgrade: an older relay
refuses a database that a newer one has migrated, by design. Release candidates
(`-rc.N`) are for testing on a relay you can roll back.

[COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md) lists what every 1.x keeps working.

## 9. Logs and privacy

- **What is logged:** at the default `info` level, the relay logs no client addresses and no
  account names; connection lines are at `debug`. Set `RUST_LOG=warn` to keep even less.
- **The journal:** it keeps what the service prints. Set its retention to match the backup
  policy, e.g. `MaxRetentionSec=30day` in `journald.conf`.

## 10. Monitoring and the container

`voipc-server --config … health` exits 0 when the relay answers on its TCP port, and 1 when it
does not. Use it from a monitoring check. The container image uses it as its HEALTHCHECK.

The container image is static and runs as the non-root user 65532. Its working directory and
volume is `/data`. Put `server.toml`, the certificate and the key there, with paths relative to
`/data`:

    docker run -d --name voipc -v voipc:/data \
      -p 9987:9987/tcp -p 9987:9987/udp ghcr.io/luki4fun/voipc-server:1.0.0
    docker exec voipc /voipc-server --config /data/server.toml admin grant <name> admin

A release candidate only gets its own `:<version>` tag. A final release also moves `:1.0`, `:1`
and `:latest`.
